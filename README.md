# Risky Roll

Welcome to **Risky Roll**, a fun and exciting dice game where the goal is to be the first player to reach the target score. Points accumulate with each roll, but rolling a 1 ends your turn and cancels your current points. Play wisely and strategically to win!

## How to Play

1. **Set the Target Score**: Use the slider to set your target score. The default target score is 50.
2. **Roll the Dice**: Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice. If you roll a number between 2 and 6, it adds to your current score. If you roll a 1, your turn ends and your current score is lost.
3. **Hold Your Score**: If you want to save your current score and add it to your total score, click the "Hold" button. This will switch the turn to the next player.
4. **Win the Game**: The first player to reach the target score wins the game, and confetti will celebrate the victory!
